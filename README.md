## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background
Biosecurity is one of the most critical pillars of livestock health management especially in pig and poultry farms where diseases like Avian Influenza, Newcastle Disease, and African Swine Fever can spread rapidly. These outbreaks cause:

Massive economic losses

Threats to food security

Loss of farmer livelihoods

Barriers to trade and export

However, many small and marginal farmers still lack easy access to biosecurity guidelines, risk assessment tools, and digital systems for monitoring compliance with biosecurity standards. Due to limited awareness, infrastructural constraints, and lack of digital literacy, maintaining disease-free farm conditions becomes difficult.

### Problem Description

There is a need for an easy-to-use digital platform that helps pig and poultry farmers adopt, track, and sustain scientific biosecurity practices. The platform must integrate:

Customizable risk assessment tools

Interactive training modules

Digital compliance tracking aligned with regulations

Real-time alerts and dashboards

Multilingual, mobile-friendly interface

Tools for data collection, analysis, and stakeholder collaboration

This system should strengthen farm-level biosecurity and support national disease surveillance and preparedness.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.

• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.

• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.

• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.

• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.

• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.

• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.

• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.

• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.

• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution

We propose a Digital Farm Biosecurity Management Portal, accessible via mobile and web, designed to guide pig and poultry farmers through every aspect of biosecurity. The key features include:

Dynamic Risk Assessment Tool

Generates farm-specific risk scores

Considers local disease outbreaks, farm layout, hygiene practices, and movement logs

Provides personalized recommendations

Interactive Learning Hub

Video tutorials, infographics, quizzes

Role-based training (farmer, farm worker, veterinarian)

Gamified badges for improving awareness

Biosecurity Compliance Tracker

Daily checklists

Automated reminders for cleaning, vaccinations, visitor logs

Digital documentation for disease-free compartment approval

Real-Time Disease Alert System

Outbreak notifications based on region

Alerts for breach in farm biosecurity (e.g., sensor data, reported symptoms)

Multilingual & Offline-Enabled User Interface

Available in major Indian languages

Optimized for rural connectivity

Simple UI with icons for low-literacy users

Stakeholder Networking Module

Connects farmers with veterinarians, government officers, and suppliers

Enables consultation and reporting

Data Analytics Dashboard for Authorities

Heatmaps of disease spread

Compliance analytics

Risk profiling for targeted intervention

## Technical Approach
Technologies to Be Used

Frontend: React / Flutter

Backend: Node.js / Django

Mobile App: Flutter or React Native

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

Cloud: AWS / GCP / Azure

APIs:

Real-time disease data API

GIS mapping APIs

AI/ML:

Risk prediction models

Pattern detection in farm reports

IoT (optional):

Add multilingual support

5. Testing

Field testing

Usability testing

Security testing

6. Deployment

Cloud-based scalable deployment

Training local stakeholders

7. Monitoring & Iteration

Improve based on user feedback

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility Analysis

Strong government interest in biosecurity

High smartphone adoption in rural areas

Digital agriculture initiatives supporting such projects

Scalable and modular design

Potential Challenges and Risks

Limited digital literacy

Language barriers

Poor rural network connectivity

Resistance to adopting new technology

Strategies to Overcome Challenges

Offer icon-based and voice-assisted interfaces

Provide offline support

Conduct on-ground training workshops

Use local languages

Incentivize usage through rewards and reminders

## Impact and Benefits
Potential Impact on Target Audience

Improved awareness and proactive disease prevention

Better hygiene practices

Reduced livestock mortality

Social, Economic, and Environmental Benefits

Higher farm income due to reduced disease outbreaks

Protection of rural livelihoods

Strengthened food supply chain

Reduced antibiotic misuse

Supports national efforts against zoonotic diseases
